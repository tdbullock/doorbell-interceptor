# doorbell-interceptor

This project uses a Digital TV dongle (RTL-SDR) to receive signals on 433Mhz and post alerts via MQTT.

## Background:
Whilst my house isn't huge, it can be a struggle to hear the doorbell from the loft room.  It's a bog-standard wireless variety from Volex, and I didn't fancy shelling out a fortune for a Ring, and had the technology lying around to try to pick up the signal.

I had intended to use an ESP8266 and a superheterodyne 433Mhz receiver with OpenMQTTGateway for this, but as it turned out, my Doorbell doesn't quite transmit on 433.9Mhz like everyone else's, but on 434.0Mhz.

I had an RTL-SDR dongle to hand (which I used to verify the frequency) and was able to use this to pick up the signal.  More of a sledgehammer than the ESP solution but extremely flexible.

## Requirements

- Any RTL-SDR dongle, mostly available for under $10 on Aliexpress or Banggood.
- The fantastic RTL_433 from https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433
- Python 3.x
  - Paho MQTT Client (`pip install paho-mqtt`)
- Optional: SDR# from https://airspy.com/download/

## Discovery

Fire up SDR# (you may need to install the relevant drivers for the dongle with Zadig)
Tune to around 433.9Mhz
Send your signal
You should see something like this:
